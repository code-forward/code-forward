## Welcome to Code Forward!

**Welcome to a community of learners united by a shared passion for code.**

As a student of Code Forward, you will deepen your knowledge of coding by building an app that solves an issue in your community. You will work on projects that have the potential to change the world. You will learn cutting edge tools and technologies. You will become a better problem solver, a better listener, and a better leader. And as the inaugural Code Forward class, you will have the unique opportunity to help de ne the future of this program.

As we begin our ten week journey from “Hello, World” to releasing your app, I encourage you to embrace the challenges ahead. Learning to code is hard, building an app is hard, and solving important problems is hard. But as Code Forward-
ers, we believe that challenges help us grow. We believe that excellence in code can come from anyone. And we believe that writing code is not only a beautiful and joyful craft, but also an ethical one.

*With great power comes great responsibility.*

Together, we will build the tools that better our communities and shape the future of technology.

### Curriculum 

At Code Forward, we build technology to change our environment for the better. All of our students design, build, and release an app that aims to  x a problem they have identi ed in their community.

Over the course of 10 weeks, students go through week-long modules that cover the fundamentals of computer science and programming, as well as a variety of Special Topics that aim to deepen their knowledge and mastery of technology. They work with social entrepreneurs and professional designers to release a beautiful and meaningful solution to a real problem and showcase their app at the end of program Demo Day.
